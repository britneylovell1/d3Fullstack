# d3Fullstack
A Lesson on Data Viz for Fullstack Academy

Clone the repo to your local htdocs folder

This is an unfinished chart. See if you can edit the JS to make a complete d3 visualization.

When you have created a basic chart, uncomment and complete the code on line 93 to add interactivity. 

Customization Ideas: 
  Edit the CSS or add your own to make the graph pop.
  Change the SVGs on the scatter plot to look like animations
  Can you animate any parts of the chart's rendering?

Hints:
  Notice the date parser on line 27. This is an integral function to rendering the time-values of your data
  On line 81 is where the JS functionality is joined to the dataset
